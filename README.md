### What is digit subtitution?

Digit substitution is a feature of the operating system that replaces digits 0-9 with native digits from different script anywhere in the user interface during rendering. The underlying data remain unchanged, it is only a "display effect". For example, a text file with numbers 0123456789 will be shown as १२३४५६७८९० when Hindi digits are substituted.
